## Section 1 — Strategic Purpose

DATA-04 ensures personnel can explain Capture Rate limitations—what percentage of actual events the system detects. Understanding limitations prevents overreliance on incomplete data.

---

## Section 2 — Foundamental Linkage

Builds on DATA-01 pipeline to explain detection methodology limits.

---

## Section 3 — Core Explanation

### Concept Definition

Capture Rate measures what percentage of actual events the detection system records. Factors affecting capture include sensor coverage gaps, detection algorithm accuracy, environmental interference, and device capability variations. Captured events represent a sample, not complete census.

---

## Section 4 — Executive Scenario

**Scenario**: System captures 70% of foot traffic. Leadership sees 10,000 visits—explaining actual traffic is likely 14,000+ requires understanding capture rate.

---

## Section 5 — Failure Patterns

1. Treating captured data as complete
2. Ignoring capture rate changes over time
3. Missing environmental factors

---

## Section 6 — Practical Exercise

**Task**: Document capture rate for one detection system and its implications.
