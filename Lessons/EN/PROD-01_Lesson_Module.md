## Section 3 — Core Explanation

### Concept Definition

Precise problem framing includes: current state (what is), desired state (what should be), gap (the difference), impact (why it matters), and constraints (what limits solutions). Premature solution focus wastes resources on wrong problems.

## Section 4 — Executive Scenario

**Scenario**: Stakeholder asks "we need a dashboard." Problem framing: What decision does the dashboard support? What information is missing? What would different information change?
