## Section 1 — Strategic Purpose

SALES-02 ensures sales personnel can qualify viable use cases—determining whether discovered customer needs align with solution capabilities and business potential.

---

## Section 2 — Foundational Linkage

Builds on SALES-01 structured discovery.

---

## Section 3 — Core Explanation

### Concept Definition

Use case qualification assesses: fit (can solution address the need?), scope (is it within deployment scope?), value (is potential revenue worth investment?), and timeline (is customer ready to proceed?). Viability requires positive answers across all dimensions.

---

## Section 4 — Executive Scenario

**Scenario**: Customer wants real-time inventory tracking across 500 stores. Qualifying: solution fits, scope is large but manageable, value justifies $200K deal, timeline is 6 months—viable.

---

## Section 5 — Failure Patterns

1. Over-qualifying (accepting weak fits)
2. Under-qualifying (rejecting valid opportunities)
3. Missing timeline alignment

---

## Section 6 — Practical Exercise

**Task**: Qualify three discovered use cases from discovery output.

## Section 7 — Assessment Rubric

| Dimension | Novice | Competent | Expert |
|-----------|--------|-----------|--------|
