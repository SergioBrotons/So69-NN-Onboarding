## Section 1 — Strategic Purpose

TECH-09 ensures technical personnel can apply incident management protocol—systematic response to technical failures.

---

## Section 2 — Foundational Linkage

Builds on COMP-05 incident management protocol.

---

## Section 3 — Core Explanation

### Concept Definition

Technical incident management includes: detection (monitoring alerts), triage (severity assessment), containment (limiting impact), diagnosis (root cause), resolution (fix), and prevention (recurrence). Structured response minimizes downtime and damage.

---

## Section 4 — Executive Scenario

**Scenario**: Multiple sensors offline during peak hours. Response: severity P1, immediate containment (failover), parallel diagnosis (network issue), rapid resolution (router reset), prevention (redundancy upgrade).

---

## Section 5 — Failure Patterns

1. Ad-hoc response
2. Missing escalation
3. No prevention

---

## Section 6 — Practical Exercise

**Task**: Walk through incident response for one scenario.
