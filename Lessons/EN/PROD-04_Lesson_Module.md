## Section 1 — Strategic Purpose

PROD-04 ensures product personnel can assess privacy risk in features—identifying privacy implications before implementation.

---

## Section 2 — Foundational Linkage

Builds on COMP-01 Privacy by Design architecture.

---

## Section 3 — Core Explanation

### Concept Definition

Privacy risk assessment examines: what data is collected, how it's processed, who can access it, what's retained, and compliance implications. Assessment must occur before design finalization to enable privacy-by-design.

---

## Section 4 — Executive Scenario

**Scenario**: New feature collects customer location data. Assessment: Is collection necessary? What's retention period? Can data be anonymized? Does this trigger new consent requirements?

---

## Section 5 — Failure Patterns

1. Assessment after implementation
2. Missing data flow analysis
3. Ignoring compliance implications

---

## Section 6 — Practical Exercise

**Task**: Conduct privacy risk assessment for one proposed feature.
