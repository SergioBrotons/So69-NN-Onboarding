## Section 1 — Strategic Purpose

SALES-09 ensures sales personnel can design Proof of Value (POV)—structured trials that demonstrate solution value before full commitment.

---

## Section 2 — Foundational Linkage

Builds on SALES-02 use case qualification.

---

## Section 3 — Core Explanation

### Concept Definition

POV design requires: clear success criteria agreed with customer, defined scope and duration, measurement methodology for criteria, resource requirements, and conversion path to full deployment. Structure prevents "proof without decision."

---

## Section 4 — Executive Scenario

**Scenario**: Customer wants to "try before buying." POV design: 2 locations, 30 days, success = 15% traffic increase visible in data, budget $X, converts to deployment if success criteria met.

---

## Section 5 — Failure Patterns

1. Scope creep
2. Missing success criteria
3. No conversion path

---

## Section 6 — Practical Exercise

**Task**: Design POV for one qualified use case.
