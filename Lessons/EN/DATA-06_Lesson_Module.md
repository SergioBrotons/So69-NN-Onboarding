## Section 1 — Strategic Purpose

DATA-06 ensures personnel can explain recurrence logic—how systems determine if a visitor is new or returning. This is essential for customer journey analysis and loyalty metrics.

---

## Section 2 — Foundational Linkage

Builds on DATA-02 unique visitor definition.

---

## Section 3 — Core Explanation

### Concept Definition

Recurrence logic identifies returning visitors through device fingerprinting, login association, or probabilistic matching. Challenges include: device changes, privacy regulations, browser clearing, and cross-device tracking. Different methodologies produce different recurrence rates.

---

## Section 4 — Executive Scenario

**Scenario**: Marketing reports 40% repeat visitor rate; IT reports 25%. Different detection methodologies explain the gap—both may be accurate within their definitions.

---

## Section 5 — Failure Patterns

1. Confusing recurrence with frequency
2. Ignoring detection methodology
3. Privacy constraint blindness

---

## Section 6 — Practical Exercise

**Task**: Document recurrence detection methodology for one system.
