## Section 1 — Strategic Purpose

CORE-06 ensures personnel can explain how computer vision (CV) and neural networks (NN) create complementary value when integrated, avoiding false dichotomies or inappropriate separations.

---

## Section 2 — Foundational Linkage

Builds on CORE-01 Brain + Muscle architecture to explain technological integration.

---

## Section 3 — Core Explanation

### Concept Definition

"CV+NN Better Together" describes how computer vision provides perceptual capability while neural networks provide cognitive capability, creating combined intelligence that exceeds either alone. CV captures visual data; NN processes and interprets it. Integration enables advanced analytics impossible with either technology independently.

---

## Section 4 — Executive Scenario

**Scenario**: Explaining to non-technical executives how combining camera technology with AI analytics creates retail intelligence capabilities.

---

## Section 5 — Failure Patterns

1. Treating CV and NN as alternatives
2. Overemphasizing one over the other
3. Missing integration value proposition

---

## Section 6 — Practical Exercise

**Task**: Create a one-page explanation of how CV+NN applies to one use case.

## Section 7 — Assessment Rubric

| Dimension | Novice | Competent | Expert |
|-----------|--------|-----------|--------|
| Integration | Separate | Combined | Synergistic |

**Passing**: 9/15 points
