## Section 1 — Strategic Purpose

COMP-04 ensures personnel can apply the Data Minimization principle—collecting only data necessary for specified purposes. This is a core privacy regulation requirement.

---

## Section 2 — Foundational Linkage

Builds on COMP-01 Privacy by Design architecture.

---

## Section 3 — Core Explanation

### Concept Definition

Data Minimization requires: collecting adequate data (not excessive), processing for specified purposes only, retaining only as long as necessary, and deleting when no longer needed. Assessment requires examining each data element against purpose necessity.

---

## Section 4 — Executive Scenario

**Scenario**: Marketing wants to collect customer birthdate. Applying minimization: Is it necessary for core service? Can purpose be achieved without it? How long is retention justified?

---

## Section 5 — Failure Patterns

1. Collecting "nice to have" data
2. Purpose creep in data use
3. Indefinite retention

---

## Section 6 — Practical Exercise

**Task**: Conduct minimization review for one data collection process.
