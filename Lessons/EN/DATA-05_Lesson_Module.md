Each KPI should connect to a decision: what will leadership do differently based on this number? Without decision mapping, KPIs become vanity metrics. Decision mapping requires specifying: the decision, the threshold that triggers action, the timeframe, and the alternative actions.

**Scenario**: Weekly report shows 15% conversion drop. Decision mapping shows this triggers pricing review within 48 hours, marketing campaign adjustment within one week.

---

## Section 5 — Failure Patterns
