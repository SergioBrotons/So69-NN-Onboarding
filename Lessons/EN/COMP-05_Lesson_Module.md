## Section 1 — Strategic Purpose

COMP-05 ensures personnel understand incident management protocol—how to identify, report, and respond to data incidents. This is critical for compliance and damage limitation.

---

## Section 2 — Foundational Linkage

Builds on COMP-01 Privacy by Design.

## Section 3 — Core Explanation

### Concept Definition

Incident management includes: detection (identifying potential breaches), assessment (determining severity and scope), containment (limiting damage), notification (meeting regulatory deadlines), and remediation (preventing recurrence). Timelines often are legally mandated.

---

## Section 4 — Executive Scenario

**Scenario**: IT detects unauthorized database access at 2 AM. Protocol activation—immediate containment, severity assessment within 4 hours, regulatory notification within 72 hours if confirmed breach.

---

## Section 5 — Failure Patterns

1. Delayed reporting
2. Inadequate containment
3. Missing documentation

---

## Section 6 — Practical Exercise

**Task**: Walk through incident response for one incident scenario.
