## Section 1 — Strategic Purpose

LANG-03 ensures personnel can translate institutional concepts between languages without losing precise meaning. Conceptual drift occurs when translations gradually偏离正确含义, creating misunderstanding across linguistic boundaries.

---

## Section 2 — Foundational Linkage

Builds on LANG-01 canonical vocabulary to maintain precision in translation.

---

## Section 3 — Core Explanation

### Concept Definition

Conceptual drift happens when translated content gradually loses alignment with original meaning through accumulated small errors, cultural adaptations, or simplifications. Prevention requires explicit vocabulary alignment, regular equivalence testing, and systematic review processes.

---

## Section 4 — Executive Scenario

**Scenario**: Translating technical documentation from English to Spanish where terms like "unique visitor" must maintain precise meaning across languages.

---

## Section 5 — Failure Patterns

1. Literal translation ignoring context
2. Cultural adaptation that changes meaning
3. Simplification that loses precision

---

## Section 6 — Practical Exercise

**Task**: Translate a paragraph of institutional content and identify where conceptual drift could occur.
