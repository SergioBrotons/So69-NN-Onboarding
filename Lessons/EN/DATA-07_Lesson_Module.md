## Section 1 — Strategic Purpose

DATA-07 ensures personnel can interpret zone performance metrics in retail and spatial analytics contexts. Zone analysis requires understanding of physical space segmentation and traffic flow patterns.

---

## Section 2 — Foundational Linkage

Builds on DATA-01 pipeline to explain spatial metrics.

---

## Section 3 — Core Explanation

### Concept Definition

Zone performance analyzes metrics within defined physical areas: entrances, departments, checkout areas. Interpretation requires understanding zone purpose, traffic flow sequencing, conversion context (browsing vs. purchasing zones), and seasonal variations.

---

## Section 4 — Executive Scenario

**Scenario**: Food court zone shows low traffic but high conversion. Explaining that hungry visitors have purchase intent explains the apparent contradiction.

---

## Section 5 — Failure Patterns

1. Uniform zone expectations
2. Ignoring traffic flow
3. Missing conversion context

---

## Section 6 — Practical Exercise

**Task**: Analyze zone performance for three zones and provide interpretation.

| Interpretation | Surface | Contextual | Actionable |

**Passing**: 9/15 points
