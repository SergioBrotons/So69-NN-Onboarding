## Section 1 — Strategic Purpose

SALES-03 ensures sales personnel can respond to surveillance objections—addressing concerns that the solution involves inappropriate monitoring or privacy violations.

---

## Section 2 — Foundational Linkage

Builds on DATA-08 aggregation vs identification to explain privacy compliance.

---

## Section 3 — Core Explanation

### Concept Definition

Surveillance objections stem from misunderstanding of: what data is collected (aggregate metrics, not individual tracking), how data is processed (anonymization at origin), and what compliance framework applies (privacy by design). Response requires education, not dismissal.

---

## Section 4 — Executive Scenario

**Scenario**: Customer legal says "we don't want to spy on customers." Response: explaining aggregate-only measurement, no individual tracking, privacy-compliant architecture.

---

## Section 5 — Failure Patterns

1. Dismissing concerns
2. Over-promising privacy features
3. Missing regulatory framework

---

## Section 6 — Practical Exercise

**Task**: Prepare response to surveillance objection with technical specifics.
