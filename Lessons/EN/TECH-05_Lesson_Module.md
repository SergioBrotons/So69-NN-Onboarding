## Section 1 — Strategic Purpose

TECH-05 ensures technical personnel can apply noise filtering logic—separating meaningful signals from environmental interference.

---

## Section 2 — Foundational Linkage

Builds on TECH-01 probe request fundamentals.

---

## Section 3 — Core Explanation

### Concept Definition

Noise filtering removes: passing traffic from adjacent areas, transient detections, sensor crosstalk, and environmental interference. Methods include: spatial filtering (location-based), temporal filtering (duration thresholds), and pattern filtering (behavioral).

---

## Section 4 — Executive Scenario

**Scenario**: Location shows 1000 visitors but only 100 enter store. Filtering explanation: we detect people walking past on street—spatial filtering isolates actual store visitors.

---

## Section 5 — Failure Patterns

1. No filtering
2. Over-filtering valid signals
3. Missing documentation

---

## Section 6 — Practical Exercise

**Task**: Document filtering approach for one zone.
