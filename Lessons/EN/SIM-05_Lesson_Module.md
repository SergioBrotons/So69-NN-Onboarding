## Section 1 — Strategic Purpose

SIM-05 ensures personnel can resolve installation failure scenarios—diagnosing problems systematically, implementing solutions under pressure, and restoring service while maintaining communication with stakeholders. This simulation develops the critical capability to handle operational crises that threaten customer commitments and system availability.

---

## Section 2 — Foundational Linkage

Builds directly on TECH-07 (Installation and Calibration), which provides the foundational knowledge of proper installation procedures. Without understanding how systems should work, personnel cannot effectively diagnose what has gone wrong. This simulation tests whether personnel can apply that knowledge to troubleshoot real problems.

---

## Section 3 — Core Explanation

### Concept Definition

Installation failure scenarios present personnel with systems that are not functioning correctly after deployment. The challenge involves diagnosing root causes from symptoms, distinguishing between hardware and software issues, identifying environmental factors, and implementing effective remediation while managing customer expectations.

### Why This Matters

Installation failures directly impact customer experience and revenue generation. Delayed deployments, repeated site visits, and unresolved issues damage client relationships and increase operational costs. The organization's reputation for reliable deployment depends on personnel who can diagnose and resolve problems effectively.

### The Discipline Requirement

Troubleshooting requires systematic methodology, not guesswork. The discipline involves following diagnostic procedures, documenting findings, testing hypotheses, and verifying solutions before declaring success. Premature conclusions, skipped steps, or failure to document create recurring problems and learning disabilities.

---

## Section 4 — Scenario

### The Setting

A customer deployment has completed but the system is not functioning as expected. The on-site technician has reported that the installation appears complete but data is not flowing correctly. Personnel must diagnose the problem remotely or through provided information, identify the root cause, and guide resolution.

### The Challenge

The simulation presents a complex failure scenario requiring:

- Systematic symptom analysis and hypothesis generation
- Prioritization of diagnostic steps based on likelihood and impact
- Distinction between multiple potential root causes
- Communication with customer about status and timeline
- Decision-making about whether remote resolution is possible or on-site visit required
- Documentation of issue and resolution for organizational learning

### Failure Presentation

The simulated failure includes:

- Incomplete information requiring inference
- Red herring symptoms that could mislead diagnosis
- Time pressure from customer escalations
- Multiple potential causes with overlapping symptoms
- Environmental factors that complicate standard procedures

## Section 5 — Assessment Rubric

The simulation evaluates multiple dimensions of troubleshooting capability:

### Diagnostic Methodology (25 points)

Personnel must demonstrate systematic approach rather than random guessing. Evaluation assesses whether logical sequences are followed, hypotheses are tested in appropriate order, and conclusions are evidence-based.

### Root Cause Identification (25 points)

The correct root cause must be identified, not merely symptoms addressed. Treating the symptom while leaving the root cause unresolved indicates inadequate troubleshooting capability.

### Solution Implementation (20 points)

Once identified, the solution must be implemented correctly. This includes proper execution of fix procedures, verification that the fix works, and confirmation that no new issues have been introduced.

### Communication Management (15 points)

Customer communication must be appropriate—neither alarming unnecessarily nor providing false confidence. Status updates should be timely and accurate.

### Documentation Quality (15 points)

Issue description, diagnostic steps, root cause, and resolution must be documented for organizational learning. Incomplete documentation indicates failure to complete the troubleshooting discipline.

**Passing**: 75/100 points with root cause correctly identified and no safety violations

---

## Section 6 — Failure Modes

### Common Failure Patterns

Personnel frequently fail this simulation through predictable patterns that reveal inadequate troubleshooting discipline.

**Symptom Treatment**: Addressing visible issues without identifying root cause leads to recurrence. If the underlying problem is not fixed, the same failure will happen again.

**Random Guessing**: Trying random fixes without systematic diagnosis wastes time and may introduce new problems. Each intervention should be based on hypothesis testing.

**Incomplete Verification**: Declaring success before confirming the fix actually works creates false confidence. Verification must demonstrate complete resolution, not partial improvement.

**Documentation Omission**: Failing to document the issue and resolution prevents organizational learning. Future troubleshooting should benefit from today's experience.

**Customer Miscommunication**: Providing incorrect status, unrealistic timelines, or unnecessary alarm damages trust. Communication must be accurate and appropriately calibrated.

---

## Section 7 — Success Criteria

### Demonstrated Competencies

Successful completion requires demonstration of the following competencies:

- Systematic diagnostic approach following established methodology
- Accurate root cause identification from available information
- Effective solution implementation with proper verification
- Appropriate customer communication throughout the process
- Complete documentation of issue and resolution
- Sound judgment about escalation and additional resource needs

### Behavioral Indicators

Evaluators look for:

- Logical sequence of diagnostic steps based on symptom analysis
- Clear hypotheses tested before implementing fixes
- Verification that fix addresses root cause, not just symptoms
- Timely and accurate customer updates
- Complete documentation before closing the issue
- Appropriate recognition of when additional expertise is needed

---

## Section 8 — Preparation Protocol

### Pre-Simulation Requirements

Before attempting this simulation, personnel must complete:

- Full comprehension of TECH-07 content
- Review of common installation failure modes
- Understanding of diagnostic tools and procedures
- Familiarity with customer communication protocols

### Recommended Preparation Activities

**Failure Mode Analysis**: Study documented installation failures from organizational history. Understand what went wrong, how it was diagnosed, and how it was resolved.

**Diagnostic Procedure Review**: Memorize the systematic troubleshooting methodology. Practice applying it to hypothetical scenarios before facing live failures.

**Stakeholder Communication**: Practice explaining technical status to non-technical audiences. Customer communication is as important as technical diagnosis.

**Documentation Standards**: Review examples of good and poor troubleshooting documentation. Understand what makes documentation useful for organizational learning.

## Section 9 — Real-World Application

### When This Skill Is Required

Personnel apply these skills in multiple real-world contexts:

- Customer deployment issues during implementation
- System failures during commissioning phase
- Performance degradation in production systems
- Intermittent issues that are difficult to reproduce
- Hardware failures requiring diagnosis
- Configuration errors discovered post-deployment

### Connection to Organizational Operations

Customer-facing technical issues directly impact revenue, retention, and reputation. The organization's operational excellence depends on personnel who can resolve problems quickly and completely. Every unresolved issue compounds customer frustration and operational cost.
