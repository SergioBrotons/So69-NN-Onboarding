## Section 1 — Strategic Purpose

DATA-01 ensures personnel can explain how raw signals from devices and systems transform into actionable KPIs. Understanding this pipeline is essential for data-driven decision-making.

---

## Section 2 — Foundational Linkage

Builds on CORE-02 Offline Business Intelligence to explain data transformation.

---

## Section 3 — Core Explanation

### Concept Definition

The signal-to-KPI pipeline describes how raw data capture events become aggregated metrics and ultimately key performance indicators. This involves collection, cleaning, transformation, aggregation, and calculation steps—each introducing potential distortions or insights.

---

## Section 4 — Executive Scenario

**Scenario**: Executive asks why foot traffic KPI differs from raw sensor count and how the pipeline explains the difference.

---

## Section 5 — Failure Patterns

1. Confusing raw signals with processed metrics
2. Missing pipeline transformation steps
3. Ignoring data quality impact

---

## Section 6 — Practical Exercise

**Task**: Map the complete signal-to-KPI pipeline for one metric.
