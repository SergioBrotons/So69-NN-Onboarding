## Section 1 — Strategic Purpose

PROD-05 ensures product personnel can identify what not to build—recognizing features that should be rejected due to privacy risk, complexity, or poor ROI.

---

## Section 2 — Foundational Linkage

Builds on PROD-04 privacy risk assessment.

---

## Section 3 — Core Explanation

### Concept Definition

"Build nothing" decisions require: honest assessment of privacy implications, realistic complexity evaluation, and objective ROI analysis. Sometimes the right decision is not building something, even if it's technically possible.

---

## Section 4 — Executive Scenario

**Scenario**: Stakeholder requests feature that tracks individual customer journeys across stores. Privacy risk is high, consent requirements unclear, implementation complex. Decision: explain risks and propose alternative that achieves similar insight without individual tracking.

---

## Section 5 — Failure Patterns

1. Building because requested
2. Ignoring privacy implications
3. Not proposing alternatives

---

## Section 6 — Practical Exercise

**Task**: Document rationale for not building one requested feature.
