### Concept Definition

Purpose separation requires: clearly defining purposes at collection, maintaining technical/logical separation between purposes, not expanding use without new consent/legitimate basis, and documenting purpose boundaries. Data collected for analytics cannot be repurposed for marketing without appropriate basis.
