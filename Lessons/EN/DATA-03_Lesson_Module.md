DATA-03 ensures personnel can differentiate Visit from Bounce—two fundamental metrics that are often confused. Correct differentiation prevents misinterpretation of engagement data.

---

## Section 2 — Foundational Linkage

Builds on DATA-02 unique visitor definition.

---

## Section 3 — Core Explanation

### Concept Definition

A Visit is a session with multiple page views or actions. A Bounce is a single-page session with no subsequent interaction. Bounce rate measures the percentage of visits that are bounces—a high bounce rate may indicate poor traffic quality or irrelevant landing pages.

---

## Section 4 — Executive Scenario

**Scenario**: CEO sees 60% bounce rate and is concerned. Explaining that for some pages (contact info, directions) high bounce is actually positive—visitors found what they needed.

---

## Section 5 — Failure Patterns

1. Treating bounce as negative automatically
2. Confusing with exit rate
3. Ignoring page context

---

## Section 6 — Practical Exercise

**Task**: Analyze bounce rates across three pages and interpret appropriately.
