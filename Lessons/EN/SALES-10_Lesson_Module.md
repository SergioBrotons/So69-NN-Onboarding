### Concept Definition

Overpromising occurs when: capabilities are exaggerated, timelines are unrealistic, or success probability is inflated. Discipline means: accurate capability communication, realistic timeline planning, and honest risk assessment. Long-term relationships depend on delivered trust.

## Section 4 — Executive Scenario

**Scenario**: Customer asks "can you deliver in 2 weeks?" Realistic timeline is 6 weeks. Response: "We can start in 2 weeks with core functionality, full deployment at 6 weeks—here's why that delivers better results."

## Section 5 — Failure Patterns

1. Saying yes to close
2. Minimizing challenges
3. Ignoring implementation reality

## Section 6 — Practical Exercise
