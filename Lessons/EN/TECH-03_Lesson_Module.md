## Section 1 — Strategic Purpose

TECH-03 ensures technical personnel can explain hash at origin process—privacy-protective transformation applied at point of data capture.

---

## Section 2 — Foundational Linkage

Builds on COMP-01 Privacy by Design architecture.

---

## Section 3 — Core Explanation

### Concept Definition

Hash at origin applies one-way cryptographic transformation to identifiers before transmission. MAC addresses become hashed values—enabling deduplication without transmitting identifiable information. Privacy preserved while analytics capability maintained.

---

## Section 4 — Executive Scenario

**Scenario**: Customer asks "how do you protect privacy?" Explaining: we hash MAC addresses at the sensor—never see or store original identifiers, can still count unique visitors.

---

## Section 5 — Failure Patterns

1. Confusing hashing with encryption
2. Missing rainbow table risk
3. Not explaining transformation

---

## Section 6 — Practical Exercise

**Task**: Document hash at origin implementation for one system.

## Section 7 — Assessment Rubric

| Dimension | Novice | Competent | Expert |
|-----------|--------|-----------|--------|
| Explanation | Confusing | Clear | Complete |

**Passing**: 9/15 points
