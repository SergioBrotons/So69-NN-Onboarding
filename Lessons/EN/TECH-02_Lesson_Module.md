## Section 1 — Strategic Purpose

TECH-02 ensures technical personnel can interpret RSSI limitations correctly—understanding what signal strength measurements can and cannot indicate.

---

## Section 2 — Foundational Linkage

Builds on TECH-01 probe request fundamentals.

---

## Section 3 — Core Explanation

### Concept Definition

RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator) measures WiFi signal power. Limitations include: environmental interference, device variation, directional uncertainty, and distance inaccuracy. RSSI indicates "how strong" but cannot precisely determine "how far."

---

## Section 4 — Executive Scenario

**Scenario**: Customer wants to know exact distance from sensor. Explaining RSSI limitations: signal strength affected by obstacles, phone orientation, environmental factors—precise distance unreliable.

---

## Section 5 — Failure Patterns

1. Claiming distance accuracy
2. Ignoring environmental factors
3. Missing device variation

---

## Section 6 — Practical Exercise

**Task**: Document RSSI limitations for one deployment context.
