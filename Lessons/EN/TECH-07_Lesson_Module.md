## Section 1 — Strategic Purpose

TECH-07 ensures technical personnel can execute installation and calibration—proper sensor deployment and tuning for accurate detection.

---

## Section 2 — Foundational Linkage

Builds on TECH-01 probe request fundamentals.

---

## Section 3 — Core Explanation

### Concept Definition

Installation includes: sensor placement (coverage, height, angle), power/connectivity, and configuration. Calibration includes: detection zone mapping, threshold tuning, and validation against ground truth. Accuracy depends on proper execution.

---

## Section 4 — Executive Scenario

**Scenario**: New deployment shows 30% variance vs. manual count. Investigation: sensors placed too high, detection zone not calibrated. Corrected installation brings variance to acceptable range.

---

## Section 5 — Failure Patterns

1. Generic placement
2. No validation
3. Missing documentation

---

## Section 6 — Practical Exercise

**Task**: Complete installation checklist for one deployment.
