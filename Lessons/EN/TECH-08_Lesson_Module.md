## Section 1 — Strategic Purpose

TECH-08 ensures technical personnel can monitor telemetry and signal quality—ongoing validation that detection systems operate correctly.

---

## Section 2 — Foundational Linkage

Builds on TECH-07 installation and calibration.

---

## Section 3 — Core Explanation

### Concept Definition

Telemetry monitoring tracks: sensor health, detection volumes, signal quality metrics, and environmental factors. Quality indicators: detection rates, noise levels, device mix. Alerts trigger when quality degrades below thresholds.

---

## Section 4 — Executive Scenario

**Scenario**: Dashboard shows 50% detection drop. Telemetry reveals sensor offline. Response: automated alert enabled proactive remediation before customer noticed.

---

## Section 5 — Failure Patterns

1. No monitoring
2. Missing thresholds
3. No response process

---

## Section 6 — Practical Exercise

**Task**: Configure monitoring for one sensor deployment.
