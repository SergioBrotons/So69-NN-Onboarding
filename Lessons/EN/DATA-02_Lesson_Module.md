## Section 1 — Strategic Purpose

DATA-02 ensures personnel can define "Unique Visitor" correctly—a fundamental metric often misunderstood. Proper definition prevents reporting errors and ensures metric alignment with business questions.

---

## Section 2 — Foundational Linkage

Builds on DATA-01 pipeline to explain identification methodology.

---

## Section 3 — Core Explanation

### Concept Definition

Unique Visitor counts distinct individuals within a reporting period, regardless of visit frequency. Key considerations include: device identification methods, cross-device tracking, time window selection, and privacy compliance. "Unique" refers to individual people, not visits or sessions.

---

## Section 4 — Executive Scenario

**Scenario**: Marketing reports 100K unique visitors; Operations reports 80K. Leadership asks which is correct—explaining both can be valid depending on definition.

---

## Section 5 — Failure Patterns

1. Counting devices instead of people
2. Ignoring cross-session deduplication
3. Mixing different time windows

---

## Section 6 — Practical Exercise

**Task**: Document unique visitor definition for one analytics system, including all parameters.
