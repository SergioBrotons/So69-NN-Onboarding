## Section 1 — Strategic Purpose

PROD-06 ensures product personnel can understand CV+NN calibration logic—how computer vision and neural network components are tuned for accuracy.

---

## Section 2 — Foundational Linkage

Builds on CORE-06 Better Together (CV+NN).

---

## Section 3 — Core Explanation

### Concept Definition

Calibration involves: tuning CV detection parameters, training NN models with labeled data, adjusting confidence thresholds, and validating accuracy against ground truth. Understanding calibration enables realistic accuracy expectations and appropriate feature design.

---

## Section 4 — Executive Scenario

**Scenario**: Customer expects 99% accuracy. Explaining calibration: accuracy depends on environment, requires training data, threshold settings affect precision/recall tradeoff—setting realistic expectations.

---

## Section 5 — Failure Patterns

1. Overpromising accuracy
2. Ignoring environmental factors
3. Missing validation requirements

---

## Section 6 — Practical Exercise

**Task**: Document calibration considerations for one use case.
